1. To find the length of Characters:

select city,length(city) from city_table;

2. Like:
The LIKE operator is commonly used with the % and _ wildcards to match patterns within string values.
Eg:
select * from table where city like 'a%';
To find all names with "e" as the second character:

SELECT name
FROM users
WHERE name LIKE '_e%';

3. Regexp:

Metacharacters: Metacharacters have special meanings in regular expressions. Some commonly used metacharacters are:

. (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.
*: Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
?: Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character or group.
| (pipe): Acts as an OR operator, allowing alternative matches.
Character Classes: Character classes allow you to match a set of characters. Some examples include:

[abc]: Matches any character "a", "b", or "c".
[0-9]: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
[^abc]: Matches any character except "a", "b", or "c".
Anchors: Anchors are used to match positions within the text. Some commonly used anchors are:

^: Matches the start of a line.
$: Matches the end of a line.
Quantifiers: Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences to match. Some examples include:

{n}: Matches exactly "n" occurrences.
{n,}: Matches "n" or more occurrences.
{n,m}: Matches between "n" and "m" occurrences.

Eg:
--Starts with Vowels
select distinct city from station where city regexp '^(a|e|i|o|u)';
--Ends with Vowels
select distinct city from station where city regexp '(a|e|i|o|u)$';
-- .* any no of in between characters, starting and ending with vowels
select distinct city from station where city regexp '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';
--Does not start with vowels
select distinct city from station where city regexp '^[^aeiou]';
--CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels.
select distinct city from station where city not regexp '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';

4. Order
--Order by last n characters order by right(column_name,n)
select Name from students where Marks >75 order by right(Name,3), ID;
